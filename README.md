I am an accessibility-focused web developer who specializes in front-end and UX. I have a Bachelor Degree in Psychology at the University of South Florida which I use to ensure strong user experience and accessibility of clients' websites. I have created interactive web-experiences for everything from non-profits and small businesses to Fortune 50 companies.

Recently, I completed **[IBM's Full Stack Developer Professional Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer)** as a way to reinforce my front-end skills while also expanding to the back-end.
